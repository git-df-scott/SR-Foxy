"""Deletion-fragile parity in the COLOURED category (SOL_5's mechanism, new carrier).

SOL_5 closed the binary-CFI-code version of this mechanism: a global parity
obstruction that dissolves after every single deletion.  The same logical form
lives in port-coloured graphs and is NOT covered by that theorem.

A gadget is (S, sigma) with sigma : V(S) -> {0, +, -}; tau0 flips + and -.
Write sigma_bar = tau0 . sigma.  The two conditions a counterexample of
Ivanov's shape (arXiv:2608.11930) needs from its gadget are

  (a) (S, sigma) is NOT isomorphic to (S, sigma_bar)     -- parents differ
  (b) deck(S, sigma) == deck(S, sigma_bar) as multisets  -- every gadget card matches

(b) matches card v of one side to card w of the other for ANY w, not w = v.
An earlier version of this search wrongly demanded w = v and was strictly too
narrow.

Coloured canonical forms go through nauty by a faithful encoding: attach to
each vertex a pendant path whose length encodes its colour, with all lengths
above the gadget order so no pendant can be confused with gadget structure.
Coloured isomorphism holds iff the encodings are isomorphic.
