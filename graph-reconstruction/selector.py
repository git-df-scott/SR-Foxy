"""Ivanov's selector construction (arXiv:2608.11930, 12 Aug 2026), r = 4.

Ports P_1..P_4 are false-twin classes of sizes (a1,a2,a3,a4).  Six pair
vertices q_ij, each joined to every vertex of P_i and P_j.  Six selector
vertices z_1..z_6 forming K_6, each joined to three q's along the six labelled
paths below.  Lemma 2.1: the port permutations extending to automorphisms of
the selector are exactly the EVEN ones, so swapping two class sizes (an odd
permutation) gives a non-isomorphic partner.

The paper proves b(G,H) >= 51 for sizes (15,16,17,18) on n = 78.  It does not
compute b exactly.  That matters: deleting a selector vertex can destroy the
very automorphism restriction that makes G and H differ, so those cards may
match too, and the true deficit n - b may be far below the bound's.
